# Salt

- Don't use table salt when cooking. It contains additives like iodine/dextrose.
- Use Kosher Salt or Sea Salt depending on what you are cooking.
- Denser the salt the saltier it tastes so if measuring use weight over volume.
- The quicker salt dissolves the less likely you are to over season.
- Food shouldn't be salty it should be *salted*.

## What Salt to Keep On Hand

### Sea salt

Recommendation: Fleur De Sel

#### When to Use

Use sea salt when the texture can be enjoyed. E.g:

- Garnishing
- Salads
- Baking (cookies etc.)

Not anywhere where the salt will be dissolved (sauces/pasta water etc)

### Kosher Salt

Recommendation: Diamond Crystal

#### When to use

Any case where the salt will be dissolved/absorbed:

- Brining/Salting Meat
- Sauces
- Pasta Water
- Blanching

## How to Salt

- Allow salt to dissolve. Taste. Adjust.
- Water should taste like sea water. 2% salinity. Taste the water.

## How It Works

- Tastes: Five types detected by the tastebuds incl. saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, umami.
- Aroma: Detected by the nose. Thousands.
- Flavour: Intersection of taste/aroma and other sensory elements incl.
texture/temperature.
- Salt affects taste and *flavour*.
- It unlocks aromatic compounds in food.
- It balances other tastes like reducing bitterness and enhancing sweetness.
- Seasoning correctly involves time. Season *within*.

### Chemical Processes

There are two distinct chemical processes that underpin the distribution of the
salt in food which are rooted in natures tendency to seek equilibrium.

Wrt. salt it is the balancing of concentration of minerals on either side of a
semipermeable membrane (holey cell wall).

#### Osmosis

The movement of water across a cell wall from less salty side to saltier side.

Ex: Salt a chicken and leave it for 20 mins. Water will be visible on the
surface.

Water moves out.

#### Diffusion

Slower process of salt moving from a saltier environment to a
less salty one.

Ex: Salt a chicken and leave it for 20 mins. The chicken will absorb the salt.

Salt moves in.
