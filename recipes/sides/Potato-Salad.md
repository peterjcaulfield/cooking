## Ingredients

- Sea salt and pepper
- 8 medium potatoes
- 1/4 to 1/3 cup Mayo
- 2 tablespoons mustard (gluten free)
- 1 bunch green onions
- 4 boiled eggs

## Method

- Peel the potatoes if desired.
- Cut into bite sized pieces.
- Boil them with a few pinches of salt until barely cooked and then drain.
- Set potatoes aside until cool. Place them in a bowl, cover, and chill overnight (must do this step for resistant starch to occur).

After chilling:

- add the salt and pepper liberally with the mayo and mustard.
- Slice the green onions and chop the eggs and add them.
- Mix everything together and adjust seasonings to taste.
