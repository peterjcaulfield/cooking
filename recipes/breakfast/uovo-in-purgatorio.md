### Ingredients:
(Serves 1)

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small clove garlic, peeled
- 1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 14-ounce can diced tomatoes
- 1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt or
- 1⁄4 teaspoon table salt, or to taste
- 1–2 eggs
- 2–3 teaspoons grated
- Parmesan

### Method:

1. Pour the olive oil into a frying pan, then grate in (or mince and add) the garlic,
scatter in the red pepper flakes, and put the pan over a medium heat, stirring,
for 1 minute.

2. Tip in the tomatoes, stir in the salt, and let it come to a bubble.
It’s got to be hot enough to poach an egg in.

3. Crack in the egg (or eggs), sprinkle the Parmesan over it, leaving some of
the yellow yolk still exposed, and partially cover with a lid. Let it bubble
for 5 minutes, by which time the white should be set and the yolk still runny,
but keep an eye on it.

4. Remove from the heat and serve—if so wished—sprinkled with a little more Parmesan
and some chili oil, and some bread to dunk in.
